# Remote Control for hobby models
This is arduino project to add remote control to hobby models using generally available components.

This project consists of three main "parts":
* Controller
* Vehicle
* Debugging

## Controller
[Mode details and STL files](https://zzbot.org/projects/remote-controller/)
### Hardware
To build controller you need following components:
* Arduino Uno
* Joystick shield v1.A
* nRF24l01 module
* 9-volt battery
* Nine-volt battery snap
* DC-DC converter (from 9v to 5v)

### Software
There are some configuration variables defined in the source code for tuning your controller.
Other than that nothing special- just upload sketch to your uno board and you ready to go.

## Vehicle
[STL files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5421100)
### Hardware
To build vehicle you will need following components:
* Arduino micro
* nRF24l01 module
* 9-volt battery
* Nine-volt battery snap
* DC-DC converter (from 9v to 5v)

### Software
Nothing special here- upload your sketch and you ready to go.

## Debugging
### Hardware
To build debugging kit you need following components:
* Arduino Uno
* nRF24l01 module
